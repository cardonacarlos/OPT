One Page Thinking - Financial Information Application
====================

One Page Thinking is an Atlanta-based small business that offers diagramming services. One Page Thinking has now developed over 350 templates of diagrams (or visual tools) that have been used to good effect in presentations to external audiencesâ€”e.g., regulators, directors, judges, lawyers, and business executives who don't have time to wade through the minutiae, but they also need to know just enough to be informed and to make sound decisions.
